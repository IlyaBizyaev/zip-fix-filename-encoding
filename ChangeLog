2.0:    2025-Oct-28 (Rust Rewrite)
    * Rust rewrite of the original C codebase.
    * Improved encoding detection algorithm:
      - Added preliminary UTF-8 validation to avoid "fixing" already correct files.
      - Enhanced Cyrillic character detection to prevent false positives.
      - Better handling of decomposed Unicode characters (like combining diacritics).
    * Fixed directory permissions handling in ZIP archives.

1.4:    2015-Dec-21
    * Stopped using UTF-8-MAC, because it does more damage than good.

1.3:    2015-Dec-20
    * Added -w switch to produce Windows-compatible archives.

1.2:    2015-Dec-20
    * Fix encoding detection bug.
    * Properly set directories permissions.
    * Fixed idempotence of double-conversion into UTF-8-MAC.

1.1:    2015-Dec-20
    * Use UTF-8-MAC on Apple Macs.
